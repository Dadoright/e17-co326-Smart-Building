### Introduction
Occupancy and Access control is an essential part of modern commercial buildings and premises. No matter which type of commercial building you work (hospitals, hotels, institutes, etc.) human interactions and security have to be managed properly. In this project we have proposed a way to automate this process. 

These kinds of buildings are usually very crowded and busy. These cause an inefficient working/learning environment for the people. The current pandemic situation puts more pressure on this matter and people are encouraged to reduce human interactions. 

When it comes to Access control, we have to consider both authentication and authorization of people. And authentication doesn't mean exploiting the privacy of the people, so we have to keep track of the people while protecting their identity. Authorisation is a main security aspect, when it comes to the safety of the company property and the people.
### Main Features of the System
1. Count the number of people in each room.
2. Number of people who pass each corridor.
3. Authentication and Authorization of people for rooms.
4. Identify the people who entered the room.
5. Daily reports on attendance.
6. Provide Occupancy details for HVAC and Safety groups.
